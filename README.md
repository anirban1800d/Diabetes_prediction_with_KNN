# Diabetes_prediction_with_KNN
This project implements an optimized machine learning pipeline for predicting diabetes by combining dimensionality reduction, wrapper-based feature selection, and distance-based classification. Instead of relying on a plain model, the focus is on improving generalization, reducing noise, and selecting only the most informative features.
